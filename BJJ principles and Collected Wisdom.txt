BJJ principles and Collected Wisdom


1) Demian Maia - your opponent should be carrying your bodyweight/ pressure while you are resting
when I rest - I should put him to work - so I don't work and he works and he gets tired
* Demian was placing his bodyweight on his opponent's turtle

2) Ed Benneville - re: keeping uptodate on the newest tournament techniques and positions
- you can determine what your opponent is looking for and prevent him from doing it - using the opposite pressure & base

3) Josh Russell - don't allow opponent to settle their weight / position on you. Keep moving
- oppnent passes guard - go to turtle and keep rolling

4) Josh Russell - let him show you the trail and you follow - when opponent goes to pass your guard, you follow to his back
- a variant of the idea to allow your opponent to move - have foreknowledge about what his options are from the position; and then move to beat him to the next position; arriving in better position that he is.
- my cut pass defense - allow the opponent to go and follow him

5) Josh Russell - if you want the opponent to go in a certain way - fake the opposite way - and make him push himself in the position / direction that you want
* ask for illustration

6) Marcus Soares - if the opponent is putting up a wall of defence - do not keep trying to walk througfh the wall; go around the other direction and look for a window

7) Marcus Soares - the 3 most important factors in BJJ: good hip movement on bottom; solid base / posture in top; powerful grip to dominate the fight

8) Mark Mullen - allowing the opponent to think he is escaping / passing your guard will divert his attention / intention and take his mind off of his defence. Her will let down his guard and be caught in a trap
You will then be granted a few extra seconds to get the best position for a submission / reversal

9) Mark Mullen - when going against a more powerful opponent - do not contest/ oppose his force. Instead, accept his force and move faster along the same direction.
* in guard passing, instead of bracketing and pushing - accept and roll with him and do a complete roll 360 degrees to reset your full guard

10) Robert Drysdale - when your opponent has focused all of his defense on a certain area - he will be its nature have exposed another opening

11) Kid Peligro - don't try to match your opponents energy - if he is younger, faster or stronger, you are set to lose. try to find a way with leverage and proper technique

12) Saulo Ribeiro - when you think - you are late; when you are late you use strength; when you use strength you get tired; when you get tired, you lose

13) Megaton - if you are straining and trying to force the technique - that is not jiu-jitsu. You must be looking to use leverage and the correct technique for the situation

14) Oleg Taktarov - in executing any technique - you must use all parts of your body
* in throwing - he explained the principles that your centre of gravity must be lower than opponent's; all parts of your body must work together; and there must be no space between your bodies

15) Bruno fernandez - the basic strategy is for the person on top to cut down movement; slow the fight and remove space
- the person on bottom/ trying to escape must use hip movement and bracing to create space

16) Jacare Souza - via Johnny Ramirez - allow your opponent 1 direction / path to escape. When he moves to that opening, clamp on your submission and go with your entire body and commitment to the submission

17) Paul Rochon - you can not throw someone who does not want to be thrown. more specifically, he is resisting in 1 direction and you can not overcome his resistance / force. However, he is also commiting his balance and momentum in ther opposite direction

18) Mark Mullen -  executing techniques to the opponent's weak side - 90% of people pass the guard to the left 90% of the time.
Your opponent has spent the majority of his time defending to that direction / side and therefore has his defence most practised. The weak side will make the pass easier and his defence less precise and slower
