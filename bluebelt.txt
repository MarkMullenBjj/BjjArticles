by the time you hit bluebelt, you should have:
1) an idea of the mechanics of the core techniques 
2) a few variations from each of the main positions (counters, escapes, hold the position and submissions)

now, you can start to focus a little more on your game

decide what techniques feel more natural for your body type and style and start to learn more deeply about those "A game" techniques and positions. Develop a number of entires to your favorite techniques. If your favorite technique is the armbar, learn how other, more advanced guys enter it and their details to tighten it up

learn what the most common counters are and how to re-counter their defense

learn where your opponent moves if he successfully counters

you can now learn more in depth about a smaller number of techniques that appear like they are a good fit for your game

also, this is a good time to find out what is your guard. there are a ton of different guard types and strategies out there. see: http://www.grapplearts.com/Glossary_BJJ_Open_Guard.html

experiment and toss out the ones that don't feel right after giving them a fair try

pick 1 of 2 and start to explore the variations within those styles. now drill those key sweeps and submissions from that guard you have chosen

That should help get your progress started again
