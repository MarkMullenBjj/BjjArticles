I think it's a little disingenuous when people take the stance that simply because you pay for a service, you are absolved of any and all responsibility in any other regard.

While that may be true with your mechanic or your dry cleaner, with your jiu-jitsu instructor presumably you have a much deeper relationship that far outstrips the bounds of a normal "service industry" transaction.

Unless you are sort of a sociopath, a BJJ coach that teaches you 3, 4, 5, 6 days a week for years or decades is in a completely different category than your plummer or the person who makes your cappuccino. It's silly to pretend otherwise.

Now, do you have the LEGAL right to do whatever you want...? Sure. Everyone is always free to act like a douche bag IF they insist on it, but that does NOT mean it is a good way to go through life.

The term "Ju" is also about the coordination between mind & body, in that, over time the body yields to the mind. "ju" is what happens over a long period of practice when your body starts listening to your mind. 
The body is no longer obstructing the will of the mind and instead is manifesting it. (I guess you could argue that in this aspect, philosophically, there is a connection to the Chinese arts like Xing Yi & Yi Chuan which heavily focus on the body expressing the intent of the mind).

Each person has their own personal objectives to training. A competitor will differ greatly from the recreational guy looking at the long term goal of training with the "Keep it playful" or similar attitude.

-The competitor (I would think....based upon observations of other coaches training others for various types of comps) is looking to narrow things down to maximum efficiency and create/implement a gameplan.....in essence, fight their fight, and dictate their opponent's. Experimentation or exploration is based upon the need for obtaining a tool or advantage that their opponent is unfamiliar with to get the job done; if something doesn't fit into this gameplan it can be discarded. A good example of this was my daughter learning setups for cross knee pick in Judo....few years ago because of the rule changes trickling down from olympic judo it was abandoned by the coaches/players.

-On the opposite side of the coin, the the recreational guy can be more of a generalist and approach training with an eye towards experimentation and much less pressure. In a way they can take a more meandering path through training and enjoy the scenery along the way of developing their skills, whereas the competitor is on more of a ruck march following a particular heading with the goal of obtaining a specific objective by a certain time. Intensity and methodology differ gresatly,

Number 1 tip for my old belt self - consolidate your techniques, ie have a tournament game, and work in progress game that is for the gym only, and keep it simple stupid

The Iowa clips were handy, though my main point is really that this kind of coaching philosophy isn't all that unique, and for sure isn't wrong or counterproductive. You see it in wrestling rooms(all levels) around the world, in boxing gyms, judo dojos, etc. The idea being that the reason wrestlers, especially those the caliber that Iowa recruits/produces, are the way the are because the programs they've come up through have helped developed the mindset that affords them the 'monstrous work capacity' they possess. So, while the regular joe may never approach that level of mental and physical conditioning, they can without a doubt benefit from the same type of coaching philiosophy.

Except, as pointed out earlier by Team Python, this is the exact opposite of what happens with "regular joes" given this kind of treatment - it burns them out, drives them away, and robs them of all the joys and benefits they could have gotten from a jiujitsu program with some kind of rational progression. And if you're talking about the 1% this apply to, they're pretty obviously not regular Joes.

Kron:
What’s your angle on the current Jiu-Jitsu-tournament panorama?

In my opinion, it’s on the decline. I feel Jiu-Jitsu is getting worse. 
These days we see blue and purple belts who think Jiu-Jitsu’s all about grabbing the sleeve and trying those little sweeps… 
I feel they lose time with all that and the sport is getting worse with that kind of game. 

But no one can control that—not me; I can only do my best to see that Jiu-Jitsu keeps moving forward, upward. 
I feel beginners these days need to get inspired by Jiu-Jitsu as a whole, not just sport Jiu-Jitsu.

She knew a LOT about making people, little girls in particular, stronger. She used to always say, this person is MORE than strong enough to do a certain skill -- let's say 30 pull-ups-- but they are too uncoordinated to do it.

I'm not an expert on this stuff, but she was always telling me we only use a tiny fraction of our potential strength at whatever "strength" we may be at. It's mostly a neurological issue having to do with getting muscle to fire in an optimal sequence. Simply gaining more mass is the sloppy, easier way to "get stronger", whereas getting more coordinated is the more efficient but much harder way. Something I believe Russian athletes in particular are into.

It's also partly what accounts for a "skinny guy" who is strong as hell, or a guy with big muscles who feels weaker than you would expect.


rue. This is why bodybuilders use a lot of different exercises, because they want to avoid the neurological gains, and focus on the muscle gain. While power lifters and Olympic lifters use a much smaller range of exercises, because they are focused on the nuerological gains. Muscle gain puts them in a higher weight class. have a look at the weightlifters in the Olympics, a lot of them are surprisingly lacking in muscle.

From Master John Danaher:

“The deepest benefits of Jiu Jitsu come off the mat.  It encourages a world-view based upon the idea of rational problem solving.  Jiu Jitsu is all about solving problems that are rapidly changing under stress, and that gives you an ability to identify the crux of the problem in front of you, even in a stressful situation and adapt your body and tactics to overcome that problem and to continue overcoming it as the problem itself changes.  It encourages you to use a very rational trial and error method, basically the same method that science uses to overcome these problems.  So it gives you this sort of problem solving mindset, which I think applies throughout life itself.” (From Open Mat Radio interview)

 

Modern psychologists say that improved problem solving skills demonstrates an increase in our “Fluid” Intelligence.  Fluid intelligence refers to our ability to learn, to reason, to recognize patterns, and get to the bottom of things.

A lot of talk on this forum about ranks and mat skills, etc. No one can deny a person is skilled when they can tap a bunch of people on the mat, at tourneys or win championships. But that does not define the art of BJJ IMHO.

I know (and have even had several admit) they have near zero standup ability and yet most will continue to progress in rank. So eventually we have a system as countlphie stated "perpetuated by the instructors above them." Add another element, that of being able to use BJJ in a fight context. In the end we get a narrowly defined and highly efficient technique base, strategy and tactics useful for an artificially defined environment. Is this BJJ?

I understand that people train BJJ for different reasons and it seems most people train it for recreational and sportive interests.....that's fine, but in other threads when we have posters stating that only people who win/place at high levels of competition should be promoted makes me fucking LOL! BJJ IS FIRST&FOREMOST A MARTIAL ART. If people want to just do it for fun and competition and can be encouraged, but the baseline of the skillsets should be toward the use of BJJ technique for defensive uses, which is standup, clinch and ground......a basic well-rounded approach to BJJ.

Perhaps we need to "SAVE BJJ" rather than "SAVE SPORT BJJ" because it seems sport BJJ is doing just fine and it's the art that slowly dieing. 

>> And there's the fucking problem when "sport" defines the direction of a style.....look at Judo.....look at many BJJers like yourself.

exactly - everybody's clamoring to win competitions, so schools start teaching only to win competitions. and like judo, nearly every martial art has fallen victim to the same thing.

we can't fix the entire art/sport, and we can't expect the IBJJF or whatever to fix how people approach competitions, or the culture of wanting to win competitions and doing everything you can to do so.

what we can do as individuals is to make sure that students at our respective schools understand and recognize what martial arts is, and what self defense is. and also to make sure they recognize the benefits of competition, but also the pit falls of it. 

>> .what is important is whether the art becomes defined by it sportive aspects. 

This mentality reflects the p.o.v. that sport/competition oriented curriculum and development is the foundation of the style and where the emphasis is or should be. If that is so for a particular school or individual.....FINE! But like I mentioned previously, seems people are of the idea that that is the defining aspect of the art and even the basis for advancement.......so what does this mean for the future of the art?

What to work on:

At brown belt the answer to this should be very simple. It’s now time to be very competitive. It’s time to get in shape, push your body, and push your game. The only way to sharpen those routes, to test those specific directions you have for the map is to wrestle competitively against as many people as possible. You need to spend sometime matching your “style” against other styles. You need to pressure test your game.

As a brown belt you need to be willing to roll with anyone that walks into the Gym. And you have to enter the roll expecting to win.

In order to do this you will need to be an athlete. You will never know how your game works under pressure unless you’re capable of pushing yourself past the point where most people tire out. If you don’t ever experience that level of conditioning, then you may never reach those points where your game becomes tested the way it should be.

You have mastered the fundamentals already. You know the technique. Now it is time to see just how good your body can perform those mechanics. Just how can you be?

As a student it’s time to push yourself more then you ever have before in BJJ. And if you have never played a serious competitive sport before, then you may be pushing yourself more then you ever have in your lifetime. It’s only in that pressure cooker that your game will finely condense into a working reflection of your own unique self. And that is perfect.

3.  He emphasizes attribute-free jiu jitsu.  99% of jiu jitsu people can recite the canned verbage about Helio being a runt and adapting the art for use by smaller weaker opponents.  99% of jiu jitsu people know you're not supposed to use strength to force a move.  99% talk the talk (myself included) but very damn few walk the walk.  Henry is a medium-sized guy-- maybe 6', 170lbs-- but his techniques really appear to be executable by a teeny-weeny against a big big one.  When he feels you pushing, straining, or exerting force, he corrects you.  I can't possibly do this facet of the experience any justice-- because I'm writing this, not letting you see it for yourself, and because I'm a blue belt talking about something that's waaaay above my head.  I can barely glimpse it myself, which is why I can't explain it or put it into words any better.  Here's a little bit of what Henry said about this subject, during his interview with On The Mat:

"The thing is when I train I always try to train like I’m weak. I basically try to train like I’m a weakling. My own physical attributes I’m always going to have, no one can take away my strength or my speed, no one can take away my endurance except me, so I always try to train like a weak person. I say to myself when I do a technique would this work if he’s stronger than me or bigger than me or heavier than me. Would it work? Would what I am doing work? If it does, that’s the Jiu Jitsu I’m looking for, something that would work on everyone. . . I think with Rickson he has always stuck to the philosophy which is really knowing how to use leverage and never use strength in his techniques. Always finding an easy way to do something. Making sure that a technique works with either gi or no gi and also making sure the technique is applicable in a fight. Also making sure that everyone can use the technique, not just a big strong guy or just a small skinny fast guy, but the technique has to work everyone. He’s always trying to find a pure answer for any type of situation."


GUMBY: Specifically, what do you think sets Rickson’s Jiu Jitsu apart?

HENRY AKINS: I think with Rickson he has always stuck to the philosophy which is really knowing how to use leverage and never use strength in his techniques. Always finding an easy way to do something. Making sure that a technique works with either gi or no gi and also making sure the technique is applicable in a fight. Also making sure that everyone can use the technique, not just a big strong guy or just a small skinny fast guy, but the technique has to work everyone. He’s always trying to find a pure answer for any type of situation.

GUMBY: Would you classify your Jiu Jitsu as being aggressive or passive or something else?

HENRY AKINS: It’s not so much “aggressive” or “passive” as it is “sharp”. You’re waiting for the person to make mistakes, and mistakes will always happen and you’re capitalizing on mistakes. For example, Rickson’s Jiu Jitsu, he’s so sharp, mentally, that in Jiu Jitsu, for every movement there’s a counter, but he can hold you in a position, know what you need to do to get out of it and he’s already got the counter set up. So basically, everything you do becomes a mistake. Even if you’re doing the right thing, it becomes a mistake. He leads you down a path where it’s a bit like being in a spider web. The more you struggle, the deeper in trouble you get.

Training time should be 1 to 2 hours a day 6 days a week
20% standup
65% wrestling
15% jiu jitsu for mma

Standup:
- a double jab, cross.. thats it
- proper motion when getting hit: don't go straight backwards, step off the line and throw combo or shoot

Wrestling:
Regular wrestling and cage work, how to use the cage to stand up, how to get to the cage if your on the bottom, how to wrestle off the cage

Jiu Jitsu:
Train your self to not go for subs. THe biggest problem with most jiu jitsu guys is they give up perfectly good positions for shitty sweaty arm bars. Just control, smother, and punch.

Rickson interview

Maynard: I don't know if you realize how significant it is but, seeing your whole family showing up in support of Royce at the UFC is a very moving image for many people. It seems that you don't see that kind of family love and pride much anymore.

Rickson: Especially in the big cities. People don't make the time to give to each other. I think that's just a sign of our times. Smart are the ones who try to preserve those old elements. People today just want to make money. I understand that and respect that but... I find myself in a very fortunate position because I love what I'm doing and I'm good at it. So I make a living.

Maynard: It seems that here in the states, people are more concerned with doing something to make money than they are with doing what it is that they love to do. They decide that money is the goal and then begin to figure out what they've got to do to get it. They forget to listen to themselves to find out what it is they really are not only best suited for but are passionate about as well.

Rickson: Yes. I think exactly the opposite. You need to make money but it should never be the priority. What you like to do is what you should try your best at doing. The money is gonna come. That's the way people really get rich, you know? They just enjoy what they do and the money comes in some way. It's the same with the work out. Some people think that the workout is to increase heartbeats or flexibility or endurance or coordination. So they make up exercises to improve one of more of these areas. 
When I'm doing exercise, what I'm trying to do is meditate. Get in a state that I feel a balance between body, mind, and spirit. It's just enjoyment. 
When I train in Jiu Jitsu I don't have a clock in mind. I'm just feeling and flowing. When playing or surfing or hiking there are no timings or special rules. If you love it you just get into it with your whole body. You don't care that it's exercise.


-------Balancing Perspective/Points of View--------

Rickson: I believe that you should have an evolutionary point of view. You must meditate, you must pray, you must be thankful, you must give. I think those things are very important spiritually for you to be at peace with yourself. Once you've tried to improve spiritually, physically, and mentally your are in a good way. Even if I lost my two legs now I don't think that it would make me lose the sense of life. Of course I'm not gonna be a fighter anymore, but I'm able to allow myself to do other things. I'm gonna try to swim. I'm gonna try to surf. I don't know what else, but I'm definitely going to still be in love with life and learning. I've always wanted to learn how to play the piano, but I've never had the time. Or play the guitar. So many things. Some people have legs and they don't use them because they've focused on something else. I think every bad thing has a good way to look at it. Of course I love to do what I'm doing, but if I get sick...understand? The mind is so beautiful and so wild and you can have so many different things. There's always a good side to everything. Nothing is totally desperate. Like "Oh...I lost my job." You lost your job? Go to the beach, man. Get some waves.

Jiu Jitsu and the Building of Self-Efficacy - Chris Moriarty
“For many people, even adults, Jiu Jitsu is the first place where they really feel like they are good at something. Most of us weren’t star high school athletes, and we weren’t nationally ranked chess players….” As Chris explains, because of the nature of Jiu Jitsu (lots of practice, no off-season, expert instructors and more experienced practitioners around you, etc…), it is often the first place where people feel like they have developed a real, firm competence in something.

Chris believes that its important for people to use this lesson to expand their capacities in all areas of life, from work to relationships to personal development. If we can use our energy and focus to build an amazing skill set in one area, why not let that inspire us to do so in all areas of life – why leave that lesson on the mat?

Chris, for example, never saw himself becoming a doctor. Its not as though anyone ever flat out told him he was incapable, but over years of school he got the impression from the opinions and comments of the people around him that he probably just wasn’t cut out for such advanced academic study. Partially through his experiences in BJJ develop him sense of efficacy and belief in himself – certainly a lesson that any dedicated martial artist could also draw on in their own life.



The Cognitive vs. The Kinesthetic Approach


           Chris believes that the way in which people make sense of Jiu Jitsu is often a matter of personality or of personal preference. The two basic approaches might be distinguished as the cognitive and the kinesthetic.

           The cognitive person tends to be fascinated with detail and with theory in instruction. The nuances and the ideas behind the technique are often more fascinating than the repetitions of the move itself to the cognitive. This person tends to explain techniques – not surprisingly – with a lot of drawn out detail. Often, the cognitive is the person who is eager to use a notebook after class or after a tournament to jot down major learning points and new ideas.
           
           The kinesthetic individual often learns and teaches Jiu Jitsu in a much different way. In contrast to the cognitive person, the kinesthetic person often does not prefer a ton of detail in the explanation of technique. The kinesthetic usually prefers to drill the technique, or having the instructor demonstrate the technique on them in order to get a sense of what’s happening.
	   
           Though Chris tends to be more of a reflective and cognitive person himself, he is quick to point out that neither approach makes one a better or worse grappler or competitor. In fact, to be a good competitor requires a thorough kinesthetic understanding of Jiu Jitsu, with the cognitive understanding being secondary in the heat of actual combat. With that being said, Chris does believe that the kinesthetic approach has its limitations in the domain of teaching. Though there is much to be learned from an instructor demonstrating a technique and noticing all the big and little things he or she does just right, the ability to articulate and explain these details helps students learn in a different fashion (and generally allows of the conveyance of information to a greater number of people at once).
            
           “You can only work on so much at once,” Chris said to me. “You consciously focus a lot on some areas of your game, and you can sort of relax with the others.” He explained that when he works a lot on refining the details of his takedown game, he often will let himself go on almost “auto pilot” when he’s on the ground. The reason being: we only have so much mental energy to allocate to developing our games. Instead of trying to critically analyze our whole game, or only the parts that randomly come into our awareness, we can focus consciously on one area and genuinely make the most of it.
	   
            For instance, if you’re working on your guard passing abilities and you find your mind filled with guard passing details and variations – it might serve you to focus on that area intensely. This will allow you to make the most of the mental energy you’re putting into this area. Then, when you’re in side control, or when you’re on bottom, you’ll still be able to work from those positions, but almost in a more relaxed way because you’re “critical / analytical mind” (and your mental energy) are in the guard passing phase. This can not only make Jiu Jitsu more enjoyable, but can speed up the rate at which you improve specific areas of your game – and over time – your game as a whole…
