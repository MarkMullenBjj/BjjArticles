GBC Training Notes 2013

Dec month was training 1/2 guard, deep half (3 sweeps)

Jan 2
- Christian kimura setups
	~ the combination is between the americana and the kimura. The Americana is threatened by controlling the wrist with your hand closest to his head, while at same time controlling my initial kimura/Roy Harris catch. Wait and go for the one the opponent wants to give
	~ principle: grasp the kimura at the hand/wrist, not higher on the arm
	~ use hip switch (1 knee up and 1 knee down) to break the kimura counter where opponent defends grabs his lapel. "Use your hips against his shoulder" switch around to opposite side while dropping up knee and raising other knee. This torque of the hips will overcome his defe3nse lapel grip
	
	
Month of January was spent on guard passing (based on headquarters of Rafael Lovato) side control attacks
- 3 main passes from head quarters: knee cut, smash pass to dope mount; hand in belt - sprawl pass (Rolled Up Alliance Newyork with Babs)
- sequence of side control > hon-kesgatame > crucfix
~ options from crucifix: mousetrap americana, paper cutter mousetrap; Renzo vs, Maurice Smith triangle setup and straightarmlock finish
~ Josh refinements of scissoring opponent's elbow between your knees, grasping his sleeve, cinching your hips into the nbear side part of the triangle before stepping over

February - LEG Locks!

- 3 entries into IBJJF straight ankle lock:
~ step back from opponent's open guard
~ mount escape - upa to hands on belt decline press to 1/2 X guard leg formation
~ sweep counter - as you are swept go to leg position
~ 2 directions opponent will move
	1 - straighten leg and turn away to run - ankle lock with his knee on the mat
	2 - stand up and weight on leg being attacked > Kenny florian upa sweep on the leg back down
	
Feb 7 - IBJJF legal footlock position
~ outside down leg position; peeled back toes as opposed to pointed toes foot position


March 7 - class photo and roll with JR 2 days after 45th bday
head and arm shoulder choke from mount
	~ opponent has prayer hands defensive position - first push his elbow to the floor and then finger walk it up
	~ at same time walk his head/ neck towards the other hand bringing your hands together
	
tips to get the choke
	~ cinch up the head grip by shrugging your arm > elbow on the ground!
	~ your knee pressure in oipposit5e direction against his hip
	~ lower your head and shoulder - coming up and underneath the chin - as opposed to on top; push and cinch
	
defense of choke
	~ 3 defenses "answering the phone doesn't work"; rollover and away; using a grip on your own thigh to create space 
	in between shoulder and your neck
	
combinations 
	~ go for ezekiel choke after stalled shoulder choke
	~ "answering machine" counter to answer phone - gooseneck wrist lock, americana
