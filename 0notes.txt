BJJ for the Long Haul

I’ve been training BJJ for about fifteen years now.  I’ve incurred some notable injuries over time, and I’ve seen the wear and tear that comes with getting older.  Most of all, I’ve noticed recovery time (from injury) getting longer and longer.  In spite of all this, I am determined to do jiu jitsu for the long haul.  The benefits far exceed the detractions, provided you aren’t forced to quit because of a body that refuses to continue training.

Given my family’s history of relative longevity and advances in modern medicine, and given that I am determined to train for the rest of my life, I can only assume that’s going to be a long time.   As such, my training has begun to change.

This article will offer three helpful tips for helping to ensure that you can train for as long as possible.

 

     Transition away from an attribute-based game

Speed, strength, and flexibility are tremendous assets in any jiu jitsu competitor’s arsenal.  However, technique is what remains as you approach an older age.  If you notice that your guard maintenance relies on flexibility (as mine does, although less so now than a few years ago), consider alternative methods for maintaining your guard.  If your passing game is all about being faster than the other person, it may be time to slow it down and see if you are still able to pass.

    Find the amount of training that works best for you

The temptation to train 15 times a week in order to get better at an insanely fast rate is almost overwhelming.  However, you have to come to the realization that you simply may not be able to keep up such a robust pace forever.  Don’t be lulled into a false sense of what you should be doing based on what keyboard warriors on internet forums think.  Likewise, don’t base your training goals on 19 year old physical specimens (who probably don’t have kids, jobs that require more than 40 hours a week, or mortgages) think you should be training.  Instead, find the amount of time per week to train that is most conductive to doing this for the rest of your life.

    Don’t worry about winning every Scramble

You may thoroughly enjoy winning the battle during “The Scramble.”  The Scramble happens when a position occurs in which the person to benefit the most is not yet determined.  The winner can be decided by either superior technique or by reacting quicker.  This is the time during a roll when a lot of ties are broken and battles won or lost.   It’s also a time that has a much, much higher likelihood of an injury occurring.  Don’t fall into the trap of having to win every scramble situation.  You can lose some of the smaller battles and still win the wars at the gym.  Even if you end up tapping because you’re not reacting as quickly as you perhaps could, you will still be able to train the next day.

The Role Of 'The Guard' In MMA 

Kris Iatskevich (Catch Wrestling coach, head coach and president of the International Submission Wrestling Alliance):

The way we work the guard with our fighters is in the optic that guard is something that may happen during a fight,not something we go to.

For example: The guy shot a blast double on me and we wind up in a ''guard'' situation. As wrestlers we are drilled to belly out after or during a takedown,so guard doesn't happen very often during our fighters' bouts,but when it does we teach them to automatically go for reversals or stand ups.

Our go to position on bottom is the all fours (turtle / defensive position), from there we automatically go for stand ups, reversals, switches et cetera, and try to bring the fight back within our world, I.E. takedowns and aggressive top dominant positions.



Roli Delgado (TUF Season 8 contestant, UFC veteran, BJJ Blackbelt and head coach at Westside MMA, Little Rock, Arkansas):

I believe seeing the guard as a position results in a decrease in the person's urgency to get up. In MMA the guard = lost rounds. You are only seeing seldom submissions from the guard in high level MMA.

I am training our new crop of fighters to stand, and of course know the basics, but in training we don't play from our backs in MMA. This is a result of my experiences personally and as a coach. I believe my extensive BJJ has hindered me some in modern MMA, and reprogramming has been difficult. Of course many of my wins were from my back but the skill discrepancies were large. Now that everyone I fight is tough I need to stay off my back. 







--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“You have many good black belts, world champion who rely their game on the gi. You can have a good transition or not”, said Roger, pointing out his friend Romulo Barral, current world champion and winner or two MMA fights, as an example.

 

“I can be wrong, but Romulo (Barral) is a phenomenal guy who has a dangerous guard and he relies on putting his feet on people’s biceps and dominating the arm. This is a strong position of his but it won’t work in MMA. I guess someone like him has to have other tools. The good things about you when you fight with the gi is your weakness when you’re fighting no gi”.

So, my goal is “strength when I can,” but I always want to make sure that my cardio is in the best shape.

Stephan: So let’s say that you’ve got a tournament 3 weeks from now. What, specifically, would you be doing for your sprint work? How long are you running, how long do you rest between sprints…

Daniel: Well, usually, for my sprints, I’ll do 50’s and 100’s. I try to do twelve 50 meter sprints and eight 100 meter sprints. And occasionally, I’ll throw in a 200 meter or a 400 meter sprint too. I don’t really time my sprints, but I try to push it a little bit.

I’m doing this at least twice a week before tournament.

Stephan: I know it’s a tough question, but technique is built on the foundation of not being tired. So if you had to break it down, what percentage of your success in Judo has been from technique versus from conditioning? Or, another way of wording the same question: ‘how important is conditioning to high level performance.’

Daniel: If 2 people are technically the same, then the best conditioned and the strongest is going to win. Whereas if someone is really strong and in really good shape, but they fight someone who’s got much better technique, then they’ve got no chance. So, technique is very important.

Occasionally, you’ll see someone who is technically better lose to an opponent who is technically a little bit worse. But in that case the person had better cardio and was able to tire the other person out. So, it plays both ways. It’s tough to say that one is better than the other.

~
And it takes 100% commitment for many throws: I think that’s one of the biggest things that people don’t always see when they watch Judo. For a lot of the throws you’re actually throwing yourself. When I’m halfway through a throw my thought might be that be my chest is going to hit the ground and then I pull my opponent between me and the ground. Sometimes, especially with beginners, it’s tough for people to get used to that commitment and then it’s tough to get the confidence to use that throw.

So, if someone doesn’t practice a throw isn’t practiced and doesn’t really commit themselves to the throw, it’s going to be tough to get it. You can end up in a lot of bad positions. But in BJJ it’s the same thing: you can’t go for a sweep with 20% of your body and expect to get every time. You might get it once in a while, but to make sure the sweep consistently happens, you have to really put 100% into it!

i know a guy, probably about 45-50, new blue belt on TRT. he uses the gel daily and is fuckin' BEAST mode all day. he says that he doubles up the day before and day of tourneys and feels hella jacked.


I train almost every class with punches at least for a couple rounds. Definitely increases the practicality of one's grappling. It also motivates one to get out of bad spots quickly, which has also helped my grappling immensely.

Martial arts has always been a bit of a "bait & switch".

People most commonly sign up for a martial art because they want to learn "self-defense", but then they spend their time dealing with things like Kata, history, fitness, etiquette, sport competition, self-discipline, stylized representation of violence, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BJJ has made this guy feel happy and vital and given him some functional skills on the ground.

To me, that's what martial arts are about. 
This exists in a different universe than what some "elite" BJJ black belt is doing to pass some other elite BJJ black Belts guard 
in a manner than has virtually no application to real life fighting. To me, THAT feels "irrelevant".

On many a wrestling room wall is a poster listing the 7 basic skills of wrestling: penetration, lift, back arch, back step, motion, positioning, and changing levels. This is wrestling on an ontological level. Every single wrestling movement reduces to one of these skills. A great coach once taught me that of all these 7 skills, the most important was positioning. If a wrestler can maintain perfect position, he can never be scored upon. By extension,a wrestler who continuously maintains position only needs his opponent to lose position once to win a match

Cormier immediately catches him in his short offense. Cormier initiates the go behind by first pulling Smith forward onto his knees.

Next, Cormier places his head "in the hole", dropping the head behind the opponent's arm far enough that the back of the head is in the ribs. Placing the head on the other side of the opponents arm prevents that arm from being raised to block the go behind.

Additionally, it is important to understand that some techniques are better suited for longer / thinner body types and other techniques are better suited for shorter / thicker body types.
 
Now, does a beginning level student need to be taught all of these variations? No. They simply need to be made aware of them somewhere along the journey. 
 
Why should they be made aware of them, but not necessarily train all of them? Simple: They may have no use for certain variations. And, while it may be cool to learn all of these variations, the bottom line is this: A student only has so much time to train. If a student is going to commit 10 hours to training, their training should be focused on those techniques / training methods that best help them accomplish their goals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I look at it as a fight between me and my anxiety. Every time I go into the gym, the fight is on. After class I feel 100 times better, and regardless of how I did, I'm the victor that day because I didn't let anxiety get the best of me.
You should also keep in mind it's a daily battle. Instead of being discouraged by this, it should inspire you. Everyday you're given the opportunity to prove to yourself that nothing will get in your way. Especially your anxiety. 

A psychologist told me once, also a 3rd Dan in TKD, that most days he didn't feel like going to class, but he NEVER regretted going and always felt better after (mentally). If you can convince yourself you will feel better after, it's easier to force yourself to go.

Mark
I had a no stripe whitebelt say to me before "I always feel nervous before class. When does that go away?"

I answered that for me, after 10+ of training it is still there everyday. Every time on the mat I have to overcome that aversion and carry on anyways. I am about to be tested by a determined opponent and my body and brain are telling me to pay attention and be sharp.

When people talk about character development through martial arts - this is the type of thing that I think of.

“Always assume that your opponent is going to be bigger, stronger and faster than you; so that you learn to rely on technique, timing and leverage rather than brute strength” -Helio Gracie

"Sempre assuma que o seu adversário vai ser maior, mais forte e mais rápido do que você, assim você aprende a confiar em sincronismo, técnica e alavancar ao invés de força bruta". Helio Gracie
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no amount of "rules" that could be changed to make BJJ a popular sport with viewers. (It's a "doer" sport, not a "viewer" sport). 

I do not believe most rule changes come about because they want to make the sport more viewer friendly. 

I think what happens is that as sports become more popular and greater value is associated with winning a particular championship, athletes and coaches come up with strategies to win within a current rule construct that detract from the spirit of the sport.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eddie Bravo: Roger Gracie said it himself. He said 'Eighty percent of BJJ is useless in MMA.' When someone is trying to punch you, in MMA, you're forced to play a clinching style of jiu jitsu. 
If you don't understand the difference between a clinching style and an open style, this will sound like German to you. In MMA, when someone's trying to punch you, you clinch to avoid getting smashed. I believe, in order to optimize your jiu jitsu in MMA, the more you can clinch, and the more you can set up submissions from the clinch, and the more you can set up sweeps from the clinch, the more your game is about clinching the upper body, the better chance you'll have in MMA. That's my opinion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have trained at both types of schools

School #1 - warmups were mostly for conditioning involving usually 100+ pushups, squats and burpees per warmup. Very tough. Classes could stretch to 3 hours.

It was a mma / BJJ competition oriented school and the head instructor didn't care if he had joe average students. He wanted to train fighters. The membership rates were double most other bjj schools cost.

This made it tough for normal guys who just wanted to learn a little bjj and maybe had some other hobbies.

School #2 - Had a much larger student membership. Much easier warmups more focused on drills or shrimp movements - sometimes just flow rolls. Technique time about the same as School#1

The idea is that the real serious portion of the class were cross training wrestling, running bleachers and training muay thai on their own time. The instructor at School # 2 placed a much higher value on rolling. Less warmup and more rolling time.

My opinion is that for competition, conditioning is uber important. However, for the majority of guys training BJJ - most just want to get a sweat going before learning something new and some time to roll before heading off home.

Rolling while tired has value (as much for the psychological training). I think that trying to acquire new skills while fatigued is an old school methodology that doesn't really standup to modern sports science.

BJ Penn answer minus linguistics fillers and paraphrased:

"MMA is good and it offers many careers in different areas of expertise but I cannot see myself teaching fighting for the rest 
of my life especially to kids or teenagers. Everybody is different ie. kickboxers, wrestlers, etc. but as far as I'm concerned, 
the spirit and essence of martial arts for me is Jiu-jitsu. I've been doing more Judo lately and if I had my wish and get my 
black belt in Judo one day, I would like to teach Judo and Jiu-jitsu together. It makes perfect sense, it's one in the same, 
it's two halves of a whole. That's perfect self-defense. You don't need anything else if your just talking about self-defense 
and not fighting for money (MMA/prize fighting)."

"I always want to be in the top position. Always. My entire game is built around sweeping my opponent and getting on top where I can use agility, positioning, and gravity to overwhelm my opponent's defenses" - Marcelo Garcia, Advanced Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, p. 203 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

wanted to bring up something Emily mentions that she learned from Marcelo. I don't think this is giving away some big secret, I'm sure others have thought of it before. But she says, one thing she learned from Marcelo is that while some people think you should train techniques on both sides this is actually limiting your training time and development.

Since you are training both sides you're cutting down the effectiveness of one side by 50%. So if you train certain techniques to only one side, your using your training time more efficiently and increasing the potential effectiveness of the technique.

Secondly, if you train a certain move(s) to one side, you can then train specific moves to the other side, moves that naturally feed into the other move based on your opponents reactions/defense/counter.

He also said don't waste time doing calisthenics in class, do jiujitsu movements AS calisthenics --

Martial artists are often slow to appreciate how their beliefs about human violence can be distorted by their adherence to tradition, as well as by a natural desire to avoid injury during the course of training. It is, in fact, possible to master an ancient fighting system, and to attract students who will spend years trying to emulate your skills, without ever discovering that you have no ability to defend yourself in the real world. Delusions of martial prowess have much in common with religious faith. A crucial difference, however, is that while people of faith can always rationalize apparent contradictions between their beliefs and the data of their senses, an inability to fight is very easy to detect and, once revealed, very difficult to explain away.

These concerns make BJJ and other grappling arts unique in two ways: BJJ can be safely practiced under conditions of 100 percent resistance and, therefore, any doubts or illusions about its effectiveness can be removed. Striking-based arts can also be performed under full resistance, of course, but not safely—because getting repeatedly hit in the head is bad for your health. And, whatever the intensity of training, it is difficult to remove uncertainty from the striker’s art: Not even a professional boxer can be sure what will happen if he hits an assailant squarely on the jaw with a closed fist. The other man might fall to the ground unconscious, or he might not—and without gloves, the boxer might break his hand on the first punch. By contrast, even a novice at BJJ knows beyond any doubt what will happen if he correctly applies a triangle choke. It is a remarkable property of grappling that the distance between theory and reality can be fully bridged.

I can now attest that the experience of grappling with an expert is akin to falling into deep water without knowing how to swim. You will make a furious effort to stay afloat—and you will fail. Once you learn how to swim, however, it becomes difficult to see what the problem is—why can’t a drowning man just relax and tread water? The same inscrutable difference between lethal ignorance and lifesaving knowledge can be found on the mat: To train in BJJ is to continually drown—or, rather, to be drowned, in sudden and ingenious ways—and to be taught, again and again, how to swim. 

Whether you are an expert in a striking-based art—boxing, karate, tae kwon do, etc.—or just naturally tough, a return to childlike humility awaits you: Simply step onto the mat with a BJJ black belt. There are few experiences as startling as being effortlessly controlled by someone your size or smaller and, despite your full resistance, placed in a choke hold, an arm lock, or some other “submission.” A few minutes of this and, whatever your previous training, your incompetence will become so glaring and intolerable that you will want to learn whatever this person has to teach. Empowerment begins only moments later, when you are shown how to escape the various traps that were set for you—and to set them yourself. Each increment of knowledge imparted in this way is so satisfying—and one’s ignorance at every stage so consequential—that the process of learning BJJ can become remarkably addictive. I have never experienced anything quite like it. [1]

Just as you would never tell a flexible guy not to use his flexibility, you'd never tell a strong guy not to use his strength.  The key is WHEN to use strength and whether you are using it efficiently.  Watch a black belt competition at the highest level and you will definitely see 2 people straining and using as much strength as they can muster at certain points in the competition. 
On the other side of the coin, I'm sure everyone has rolled with a new guy who doesn't know any technique and tries to use strength the whole time and burns out after just a few minutes.

“Working 40-hour shifts, trying to be a machinist.

And then I’ve got the other guy on my shoulder saying, ‘Man, get your ass out of bed and shut up. 
This is what you wanted. This is what you dreamed of doing.’”

We are all the custodians of our own destinies, and we must all try to do the absolute best with what we have to work with- sometimes you will have great successes and other times colossal failure, but if you don’t try time and time again, you will be left on your couch with nothing but a bucket of “What-ifs.” You have no choice in this life but to push forward and try to do the best you can.

My challenge to you, and myself, is to continue to press on and make the most of your adventure here on earth. At the end of your life you want to be sure that you’ve made your best effort to make a collection of epic stories. Some sorrowful ones, some happy ones and some downright amazing, but the challenge for you is to find and make the most of each of these adventures.

No its not called by lack or preparation. My old boxing trainer explained it to me like this. If you are in shape, you can go 80% all night long, 90% for 3 rounds, or 100% for 90 seconds. He said if you choose the 90% or 100% route, you had better win in that time you have, because you simply cant, and wont recover. a proper paced fighter fights consistently at 80% and bursts to 100% in small moments for just a few seconds at a time.

Sometimes nerves, mistakes in judgement, etc, makes a guy put it out there at 100%, and no matter what conditioning you have, you simply can not recover from this during a fight. Mental discipline during a fight and staying relaxed is just as important as physical conditioning. 

Great post.

Anyone who has trained has been there.  You bump it up to 100%  and keep it there a little too long either out of bad judgement, or because you think you can finish then don't.  Either way, it's almost impossible to recover from during the fight.  It's like you are trying to catch up for the rest of the fight.

Ever get to where you are so tired it's easier to just eat punches then it is to get out of the way?  I have.  It looked like that's where Miller was.  It's a horrible place to be.  It reminds me of a recurring dream I used to have as a child where I'm trying to beat up a bad guy, but my arms are moving so slow that my punches can't hurt them but they are moving normal speed and are destroying me.  You feel like you are fighting under water.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

jiu jitsu is no longer about creating people that can fight, so self defense is not a requirement and shouldn't even be brought up.

Practicing how to defend your face from being caved in from someone twice your size will take away precious drill time on your berimbolo transitions. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I also try to stay as neutral as possible emotionally. Some guys get all worked up but I try to keep it even... and cultivate what I call a 'cyborg mentality'. 
I do the same with eating. I drink a lot of meals that are very high in nutrients even if they don't taste great. Like a machine getting the best fuel. Likewise, just show up to work out regardless of emotion. That keeps me more consistent and less dependent on changing feelings and thoughts.

I'm. certainly not saying the intensity level isn't higher, etc, but is bullshit that sport competition is what BJJ is about.

Sport JiuJitsu is one facet of BJJ and IMHO the least important due to its increasing specialization as in any other sport where winning create artificial environment defined by rules leading to strategy and tactics designed for the environment 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MG says if you think both your sides are as good as the other at a given move, chances are that neither one is very good. :) He definitely advocates mastery of a move on one side, then forcing your opponent into that game in that side.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In that lesson I talked once again
about the video where BJJ phenom
Gunnar Nelson credits the mental
relaxation he maintains during rolling
as the primary reason he has been
able to become world class in such a
short period of time.
 
It is almost like Gunni (his nickname)
has an internal agreement with him-
self, like an ethic, that he will not use
any more energy or physical attributes
than is absolutely necessary to execute
his technique with maximum efficiency.
 
Sometimes it looks like if he really 
exploded and scrambled hard he could
beat an opponent to the punch, but he 
will back off and feel for a different 
path....




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I teach a specific position for three week blocks. 
Within that three week block, we go over, offense, defense, submissions, position details, transitions and everything in between depending upon what position we are working on (i.e. side control instruction and curriculum is going to be vastly different then butterfly guard). 
I feel its a really good way about going over things without it getting boring.
I rotate through all the position and make my back to each position throughout the year building on and re enforcing things that we did before moving on to new techniques.

Small tips that fixed big problems for you:

- almost every move works better if you are facing them but they are not directly facing you (strong angles)

- sweeps and takedowns against good people usually require some element of action/reaction, kazushi (off-balancing), or "taking them one way, then taking them the other"

- keeping your elbows glued to your hips/ribs/thighs/knees (depending on the scenario) kills the great majority of open guard attacks

- the guy on top in closed guard must keep his head behind the plane perpendicular to the floor and running through the opponents hips, otherwise, he can be broken down or swept

- it's not enough to have the underhook on the bottom halfguard, preventing the crossface is also critical

- bridging a mounted opponent requires their head be across the vertical centerline, therefore, if the top guy is off-center, he first must be brought to the center before initiating the bridge

- creating a kinetic chain from the ground, through at least one foot, through to the point being moved (Rickson's connection principle); this is why so many shrimps fail, there is not good connection

- if your guard has just been passed, do not let your opponents head cross your centerline, or his arm crossface you; keeping this in mind is important to recovering the guard and not ending up in bad side control

- most high level guys increase top pressure by applying some kind of structural torque

- chokes that are set up properly rarely require a strong squeeze, usually very little if any squeeze is required

- deep figure four grips (achieved by rotating the monkey grip far around the wrists like a motorcycle) are much harder to break

- ratcheting or "earthquake" motion can often break a grip much better than raw strength 

"Go with the pressure instead of against it"

Instead of trying to "stop" everything someone is trying to do, often times going "with" the pressure can lead to escape. Kind of like rolling with punches.

Couple examples:

Shoulder rolling to turtle or back to guard vs stack passes

Spin out armbar when being stacked

Spin out escape to counter americana from side control

Lifting the chin and moving "in" to bow and arrow chokes to escape

Another similar theory is to anticipate that the other person may resist direct pressure so send it the other way first so they will resist "towards" your original intentions.

Basic example

Trying to pin the near arm down when in top side control: Switch to Kesa and pull the arm, when they pull back, shoved it down, switch, and block with the shin. 


"You can either move your opponent around you, or yourself around your opponent"
"If you don't know what to do, keep moving."

If you're not sure what someone is doing to you, just don't let them do what they want.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well unfortunately all the evidence on this subject matter says that you are wrong.   We like to think that we have some type of switch that we can simply toggle back and forth between our sportive game and our more realistic game.  The fact of the matter is that in a real life or death situation, you will do what you practice. 

What do I mean by in a life or death situation?   I mean in a surprise situation where you are in fear for your life, you don't take the time to rationalize through all the different techinques you have learned and read through them like a rolodex until you have found the right one... it's much more mathmatical than that.  If in that situation you have done X technique 75% of the time in practice and had success with it, you are 75% likely to do X technique in a fight for your life even if that would get you killed.   Why, because at that point your subconsious is normally in control, and your ability to rationalize and use your fine motor skills are gone.  If you would like to read more on the subject matter,  "Sharpening the Warriors Edge" by Bruce Siddle.  I have read probably 2 dozen books on the subject matter and pretty much all say the same thing, in summary "Perfect practice makes perfect."

Firearms instructors have been saying this for years... "Never expect to rise to the occasion, you will always default to your level of training."

"I put a BIG pressure"

Carlson Gracie's best advice to us when we ended on the bottom was "stand up." Guys who followed that advice became very hard to hold down.

Carlson BJJ:

1. Prefers to fight on top and has a crushing top game.
2. Dangerous guard, but not necessarily one's go to game.
3. Devastating knee on the belly.
4. Pretty good judo (you've seen those uchi matas Carlson hit on Santana).
5. Deadly kimura and cross chokes.
6. Well rounded game that transitions well to vale tudo.
7. Excellent self-defense.
8. Extremely aggressive and confident.
9. No fear.

gi vs no-gi

People get a misconception that grabbing clothes means you are going to play some homo shit like the spider guard, or use both hands to do a cross choke on a t shirt. The spider guard has nearly ZERO application to fighting except for the fact that you can practice using your feet to defend punches, that's pretty much it. I'm not talking about that grabbing clothes in that sense.

Do greco roman clinches but allow grabbing of the clothes and see how different it is. You can grab the back of ones collar and snap them down, control them with that hand and punch the hell out of them with your other hand if you want. When you get a dominant position and just want to control someone you can do it much easier when you grab the clothes, whether it's from mount, side mount or knee on belly etc.
You can create distance with a grab, it changes things a lot. At the Gracie Academy and Valente school in Miami they punch and kick, with the gi on.

So often you see how street fight ends. That's with someone's t shirts all fucked up and ripped. You see what I'm saying. Imagine if you had some knowledge of how to use those grabs instead of just grabbing and going wild like someone with no experience.

The OP is asking about a street fight. Not an MMA contest. Street fights last maybe 30 seconds, usually less. These instincts you are talking about. It's a bit of a stereotype. There IS a problem with BJJ today. No doubt. Nobody is teaching self defense anymore and nobody is practicing it. There are black belts who never train the self defense, never trained rolling with strikes, don't practice clinching against someone throwing strikes and throwing kicks. Too much emphasis on points. People think they win because they got a sweep or passed someones guard. I only mention the Gracie and Valente schools because they do roll with strikes and always practice closing the distance against punches, kicks and knees.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Professor De Lima talk a lot about Judo, saying it was too closely related for any jiu jitsu black belt not to receive (or have the expience to be) black belt in Judo. He was moving his demonstrator like it was nothing. I never really got into judo because it always involved me hitting the ground very hard. I respect any real Judo player. That takes a certain kind of heart to sacrifice the body like that. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This thread has been done atleast six times before. Lloyds team is succesful for a couple of reasons.

I feel Master Irvin has found what works and emulated or distilled it down.

The team trains like professional atheletes.

Lloyd finds highly effective techniques and they train them to death. Rhadis Gripping Technique, The Mousetrap, Unstoppable Sweep... ETC.. This becomes very apparent at tournements when they finish there opponents in very similiar fashion.

They emphasize toughness, aggression, and finishing the transision in a dominant position.

Lloyd instills a winners mentality.


Lloyd works the transitions because that's what opens and closes doors. My pass is the knee cut across pass; some call it the Margarida pass, although I tend not to take the far side underhook out of the gate.

My "position 0" for that pass is the transition. Not the pass itself, and not the entry to it. Everything in my top game is about getting to that spot, while looking to improve my position and/or submit.

Once I am there, there are maybe 6 or 7 things a guy can do to me that are "technically correct," responses. I have an answer for each of them. Other responses are mistakes, by definition.

What this does is neck down the infinite, but bounded, world of BJJ into something manageable, while it also forces the other guy to play right in your wheelhouse.

You might not win. You might get stomped. But your odds of winning improve because you're herding your opponent into your comfort zone.

The transitions matter so much because it's so much easier to finish the submission once locked in, hold the back once you've taken it, etc. It's getting there that is the hard part.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Training transitions simply means, instead of just teaching a move or a set of moves from a position, they show how the position is attained, the options you have, the opponents reaction(s) and what can be chained from there. It is more or a less a game plan.

[quote]Graciebarra 847 -     What are some qualites that make an instructor good?[/quote]

the best instructors that I had had a great depth of technical knowledge, so when you asked a question you had a reasonable expectation that the answer was solid and you could disregard some of the other information on the subject

for example - there are a ton of armbar instructionals on Youtube. But that doesn't mean they are solid information.

While you are sorting through the variations and different approaches, a good instructor can save you hours of wasted effort going down the wrong road or worse, developing a bad habit.

all of the armbar variations might work in certain situations or with lower level opponents. Only a few variations will work against fully resisting opponents, with a few years of mat time who know that you are trying to armbar them

   What are some qualities that make an instructor bad?
[/quote]

the single worst instructor I had was when I started in judo. He was a blackbelt who was filling in while the head instructor was away in Japan.

my brother and I were trying to learn the ippon seionage and the substitute instructor was hovering nearby. We were trying to do uchikomi - putting the footwork, correctbalance, hands,..everything together

he would stop me in between every single rep to give a 3 minute discourse on some minor point - completely stopping my attempts to get a rhythm. It was really frustrating to not be able to just grunt it out and try to make the movement familiar to my nervous system

sometimes you know what you are supposed to be doing - but your body just isn't coordinated with this new movement. You need to work through a few reps on your own even though you haven't perfected it. Imagine trying to learn to jab and being interrupted between every punch to be corrected. Sometimes you need to let people execute enough reps with a non-perfect technique just to let them get comfortable with it then, add a few more points a little later. Rener Gracie calls it 'shading' as a method of teaching

it isn't about allowing someone to develop a bad habit - rather they need some time to just try it a while on their own without constant micromanagement

I have been pretty lucky to have great instructors along the way


I test for belts. My coach doesn't. Both have their plusses and minuses. I want to know that there aren't holes in my students game that they plug with exceptional skill in other positions 


A leader is best when people barely know he exists. When his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves. - Lao Tzu

Jiu Jitsu taught me that I don't have to push others around. I only need to move myself in relation to them


"“I feel great,” said Evans, who fought for the first time in more than a year. “I feel like all the trials and tribulations have paid off. 
When you’re in the valley, you’re tested the most, not when you’re at your peak.” "

Opportunistic VS. Leverage Based Moves
ex. Ezekiel Choke vs, Clock Choke


If you use all of your base, of your positioning and weight - you can get it eventually
Ezekiel - he has to create the opportunity for you to execute the choke




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What you're talking about in terms of "flow" etc is nothing more than the NATURAL process of skill development. 
In other words, when one progresses to a mid to high level of proficiency and expertise in ANY skill, one NATURALLY acts or moves with fluidity without much thought or mental effort. 
Again it is the natural process of skill development and expertise.
Everyone will reach that level, provide they stick with the art or activity long enough.


It is called "unconsciously compentence" or "automaticity".


It common not only for experienced Bjj practitioners but also musicians and athletes of various sports like basketball, soccer, etc.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In many ways it is. A higher level of competition forces you to push yourself further. 
This includes preparation in terms of strength and conditioning as well as technique and strategy. 
It also exposes you to a high pressure situation in which you learn to deal with adrenaline and nerves. 
In competition you are also exposed to a wider range of techniques from different opponents and gyms. 
These are all important parts, perhaps essential parts, of improving your game.

However the rules of competition are being criticised by some who claim that it encourages a style of jiu jitsu 
that is effective for winning tournaments and yet not for self defense or mixed martial arts. 
Also the way the points are scored, sometimes aggressive jiu jitsu that looks for the submission is replaced 
with stalling that aims to secure a minor lead. This does not seem to be to the benefit of fans spectating 
the sport and arguably does not help the art evolve.

For example at the 2011 Munidals, in the men’s black belt divisions, not a single final match was won by submission. 
Now some of these matches were aggressive and entertaining and within the time limit securing a submission 
is not always possible. However in only 3 of the 10 finals did a competitor score more than 4 points. 
Even Marcelo Garcia who is known for always looking for the finish, secured 2 points early and held on for the victory. 


Rickson interview:
Very wise words from Master Rickson. He really clarifies that Jiu-Jitsu is way beyond a set of rules that BJJ has. 
There is no time or points in Jiu-Jitsu, otherwise you are putting a limit on what you can be. Hope you all enjoy it

Inside BJJ
If you could only pick one thing that an individual could start today that would improve their Jiu-Jitsu what would it be?

Lloyd Irvin
Drilling of transitions.  I believe that is the most important aspect of making rapid improvements in Jiu-Jitsu.  
If you understand what all of the most important transitions are in Jiu-Jitsu and you focus on drilling them you’ll 
make amazing improvements very fast.

I wasn’t in an ideal situation to reach all of my goals in BJJ and I have dedicated myself to helping others reach 
their BJJ goals.

Inside BJJ
What is your personal philosophy on BJJ and life?

Lloyd Irvin
You’re either winning or losing.  And each and every day you’re either moving closer or further away from your goal.  
No matter what your goals are.  For BJJ, no matter if you want to compete or not.  
In life, deciding on what you would consider success and putting yourself in a position to become successful.  
97% of the population is losers and only 3% of the population is winners and you have to decide what percentage group you want to be in.  
Then surround yourself, or find a way, to get around the 3% group.  
For example, in BJJ, if an instructor makes excuses for their students losses like, 
“Don’t worry about it, he was stronger than you, he outweighed you, he’s a 3 stripe purple belt and you just got your purple belt” 
then that instructor is in the 97% group, the 3 % group doesn’t make excuses.  
I could go on and on about this but hopefully you get my point.  
I believe that in everything that you do you’re either winning or losing, either doing what it takes to win or lose and 
you just have to be honest with yourself and decide if you want to be a winner or a loser.  

If you want to get your masters degree, then winning will be actually getting your masters degree.  
So. if in your quest for your degree and you skip a class, then you’re losing that day.  
If you fail to complete your homework, you are a loser that day and so one.  
You’re either winning or losing.  This applies to everything.

Difference between BJJ whitebelts and blackbelts?
- The white belt can't wait to go to brazil, the blackbelt can't wait to get the fuck out!!! 


But typically i see guys who took 3 months of BJJ quit,
then walk around in tapout shirts at the bar talking about how they train

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ear protection variable aside, it's mostly genetic...

If your ear cartilage is quite "stiff" you are very prone to it. If your ear cartilage is very "rubbery", you are far less prone to it.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teaching is a progress killer. 
I think that being a good teacher means you invest in the progress of your students rather than focusing on your own improvement.  I am not saying it is a bad thing, but I do think if your primary goal is to get as good as you can then you shouldn't be focused on teaching.  

I know other people will argue that teaching forces them to really break a technique down, but in BJJ the intellectual understanding of the parts of a technique is not the same thing as the ability to apply techniques instictively.  This is why many world champions can be terrible teachers.  And the truth is most of the great competitors in our obscure little sport have to teach to make a living.  

If by personal progress were talking about growth and development in a general sense then teaching others will only enhance one's growth and development because in explaining techniques, combinations, principles to others one clarifies them for oneself.


If by personal progress were talking about performance in either sparring or competition, then there shouldn't be any hinderance or interference considering the teaching and performance in sparring or competition are two totally different things requiring different types of mental and physical preparation. 

teaching helps you understand techniques better but it kills the amount of time you get to really apply/practice the move. In order to be a successful competitor you need to be sharp with the moves you know - teaching takes away time from that kind of training. As an instructor, you never really get to roll, you're always kind of watching out of the side of your eye to make sure noone is going crazy or a student is hurting another students. 
Being a pure student lets you completely train for yourself. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Most of the students are insecure suburban white guys pretending to be hard in $200 uniforms, that's the sort of people that just have to manufacture drama.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As our Judo community shies further and further away from competition, and our inventory of Judo techniques is further 
emasculated, real Judo seems to be disappearing from our curricula. While the rest of the grappling world revolves around 
highly combative, functional, and practical skills, we are left with just a shadow of what Judo used to be. 
Unlike Judo, the other grappling arts have no kata, no limiting go kyo no waza, and no “demonstration” or “theoretical” 
techniques. They only have practical skills for combat. 

We too must get back to teaching practical Judo skills 


A huge percentage of guys at non-contract gyms won't make it a month. The ability to lock people into contracts is the 
only thing that will cause increasing percentages of people who make blue.

After those guys, most people won't make blue.

Immediately after getting their blue, a ton of people disappear.

Those who survive the post-blue period don't quit. They get hurt, move, or focus on their girlfriends.

Then you have those who make it to purple. It's probably less than 1/250 that pay to train, and 1/500 that walk in the door. 
The only reasons they stop advancing is moving, getting married, job changes, and politics. 
Consider that most people get into BJJ during or after college, and as a result, purple will be the first major test that 
is beyond normal perseverance--these are serious lifestyle changes.

If you survive all of that it's a matter of time and politics.

As far as learning names--it's really a sport where you come up with a class of guys who join around your time. This makes beginners/advanced classes troubling as far as team building goes IMO, because people spend their first year in a group with tons of other guys who quit, and then you have small groups that advance together and are outsiders to the older advanced groups. You're with your core belt group basically until people fade away.

nterviewer: How did Zuluzinho got that big (2m e 175kg)?

Zulu(his father): He was planned to be the giant that he is now. I wanted to make a big fighter. 
Zuluzinho's mother was friends with a friend of mine. 
When I saw that huge Negress taller than I was, I thought, I'm gonna breed with this Negress! 
I squirted a liter of milk and I got out to the left side so the kid would be a male... because when you get out to the right side it's a female.

I happen to agree in that I would only purchase DVD's that teach me how to Spring Break style scissor with other dudes 
for advantage points. 



Chocolate Shatner - 
Additionally, I can see it from the perspective of a BJJ player, having been a guy who has trained with them, as well as without a gi with Greg Jackson. To go from the very open worlds of nogi and BJJ to judo is very frustrating. 
In nogi and BJJ, while the scoring rules can be up for debate, almost all other rules are only there for safety of the competitor. To go from that to judo with the numerous gripping rules, timing rules, banned techniques for no reason other than the IJF deems them "bad", etc, etc ad nauseaum would make many people not want to try it out.


.....But, some of their ideas make sense. For example, why have people training techniques that are ineffective? 
Why allow players to drop and turtle with no penalty, even though in real life that would be a sure fire way to get kick-fucked? At least with a guard pull you can still somewhat use your arms and legs to defend yourself. 

Okay I get that but you mean I can't grab the legs? I can't grab both my hands on the same lapel? Can't grab the back of the gi after how long? I can't grab his gi like this at all? Can't touch his neck? Can't lock my hands? You mean if I toss him onto his back like this I instantly win?

In wrestling there is this rule set that sort of says "you took him down didn't you? Well you get 2 points now keep going" which is exactly how it is in BJJ. There is no ippon, there are no suicide throws, and there is no turtle and wait to be stood up in 5 seconds. If it goes to the ground you continue. 
In judo you go for something and it doesn't go through but you save it by going to your knees to turtle(if it gets even that far) and it gets restarted so you can try again(drop seoi nage anyone?), in bjj you go for a takedown, fail and there is no restart(guard pull anyone?). 
Well in wrestling this restart doesn't exist either which coincides with bjj, so again comes from that "well you get the guy to the ground or not?" mentality.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#2 It's made me focus on getting back to my feet instead of working guard if I get thrown (not an ippon) and end on the bottom. 
Carlson Gracie used to hate it when his Chicago students relied on the guard (i.e., recompose) to escape a bad position. 
Whenever you ended up on the bottom he would yell "Stand up, Stand up, Stand up!" even if the other guy had a full side control 
on you. If you resorted to guard he would yell in frustration "Porra! No put in guard." 

Judo has allowed me to really work on this aspect. Whenever I'm knocked to my knees or thrown to the ground with a yuko 
(but) or wazari (side) I commit 100% to getting back to my feel instead of using guard. I only use guard if I have to.

"I break jiu-jitsu into two categories – functional and dysfunctional," Drysdale said. 
"There's the functional stuff that will work in every arena. 
Then there's the dysfunctional stuff that only works for high-caliber competitors, which I kind of moved away from. 
It's just stuff, in my opinion, that isn't functional for MMA. 
I try to put my efforts into things that are functional for everything.

I agree with most of the points in your video. I like the fact that my head instructor has fought mma and competes in national level grappling tournaments. Both BJJ academies that I have trained in were heavily slanted towards competition.

Having said that - I have never competed and likely - at the age of 43 never will. I am a brown belt in both bjj and judo. The spirited matches in the academy satisfy that aspect of my personality.

It just was never one of the reasons for starting jiu-jitsu for me. I was a bouncer for years and never shied away from a fight - although I probably would be nervous for a competition. I had only 1 street fight that occurred just before my bluebelt and it went pretty well how you see in the Gracie in Action videos.

I just never got excited about the idea of entering bjj competitions. Some of the new whitebelts at our academy can't wait to get into their first tournament and would compete every weekend if they had opportunity!

I accept that in most practitioner's eyes that leaves a hole in one's bjj resume. I do jiu-jitsu on my own terms.

In most academies, the noncompetitors will train alongside the guys doing the tournament next weekend. You will be forced to train at their intensity and pace and get a close view of the level and intensity of that bjj. In my first academy, we all had to do the same difficult warmups as the competition team and the rounds of sparring. Everyone got promoted after the tournament. In the preparation for the tournament, the instructor had a pretty good idea of where your skills stacked up against the rest.

While not disagreeing with your points - I think that an important measure is if you can defend the belt (in live rolling) or not. We know that it is difficult to fake grappling and if you have the technical knowledge and the capacity to actually utilize it against a fully resisting opponent in the academy then that is a great barometer.

Granted, the non compettitors didn't have to deal with the nerves and adrenaline of the compettion. And the competitors deserve FULL credit for that. I will acknowledge another level of respect for those who compete.

On the other hand - my technical understanding of many of the positions was superior and I was able to teach many of the competitors!

I read on the Gracie Barra website one time that an estimated 15-20% of bjj practitioners competed in tournaments. If lack of compeition experience precludes getting a blackbelt that excludes 80% of practicioners from ever achieving a blackbelt!

In the end, you have to do bjj for your own reasons - which may or may not include competition

Little Carlson Gracie Story

    Here's a story I got from one of my training partners (Brown Belt) when he was training at CARLSONS in Chicago a few years back...


    A couple students were practicing a "fancy" sweep and counter from the X-Guard / Z-Guard or something similar (can't remember). Carlson is watching on the sidelines.

    The student doing the sweep asks Carlson: "Hey, Professor... how would you get out of this sweep?"

    Carlson says: "Punch you in the face"

    The student asks: "No, for tournament"

    Carlson, perplexed, asks: "For a tournament...? Why you want to practice technique where your opponent can punch you in the face easy?"

    Carlson then shows the two students a different sweep from the same position that would work in MMA/ fight as well as a sport tournament.


    I like this story because it demonstrates the different "old School" mentality about training that Carlson and some others had; Jiu jitsu is for fighting first and formost. Don't loose track of that and make your jiujitsu a "sport only" style. 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Helio Gracie's definition of a blue belt was someone who can defend themselves from a larger, stronger person's attack. Brand new guys who go crazy are IDEAL training partners for an experienced student of jiujitsu because they will do unpredictable, nutty things that don't make sense from the perspective of a trained guy. That's what makes them great. 
If you can't defend yourself from untrained madness, you shouldn't have any color on your belt.

I remeber someone asking Relson one time, why he never made a book on his jiu jitsu. His answwer was it would only be about 6 or 7 pages long!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think one way to possibly describe the difficulty in communicating what you saw is that I get the impression that Rickson’s Jiu Jitsu is described in terms of relationships. What I mean is that combat isn’t just about person A performing a technique to which person B has (or doesn’t have) a response, it’s about something a little more encompassing regarding the infinite variety of give and take between two fully conscious opposing forces.

The best practitioners of jiu jitsu arrive at a similar conclusion subconsciously due to bio feedback but without fully adopting it or applying those principles they may use more strength than needed in certain situations. Perhaps the reason why there are so many stories as to how impressive Rickson is in rolling is because his jiu jitsu isn’t just about technique but how he relates specifically to that specific opponent. Communicating this would be as hard as communicating how you relate to your best-friend and how that could benefit other people in their relationships with their friends.

All you can do in these instances is come up with vague “principles” and demonstrate how to employ these principles to specific situations taking into consideration everything the opponent is doing. Just like there is no magic set technique for being a better “friend” when things get “tough” there is no magic set technique for being a better opponent when they’re trying to introduce a difficulty.

This all harkens to the unfortunately all-to-abused terms like “flow” and Bruce Lee’s “Become water my friend” but it seems more apt in this situation than ever. Being like water requires a very high degree of unconscious awareness that is apparently only possible after a good deal of conscious practice. Find the principle, try to maintain an awareness while practicing it until this awareness is automatic. As odd as this may sound applying this principle to your personal relationships should be equally rewarding. Be forgiving and loving to a fault and don’t take personal injury too seriously (just as an example – I don’t want to turn this into a relationship discussion)– difficult to apply but with practice becomes easier and then automatic and miraculously your relationships are more rewarding and positive. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As I do not train with Alliance, I cannot say for sure, but I think what they are doing is probably just what is standard in professional sports.

For their competitive athletes, they probably have people providing
-professional strength and conditioning
-systems for regular drilling
-team training where the athletes get to train with other high level athletes and get direct coaching and feedback from each other and the head coaches
-organized curriculum for learning new material and refining old material
-probably some kind of nutritionist for the higher level guys and gals
-training camps where the major athletes from the different branches of Alliance can get together and train, exchange ideas and formulate team and individual strategies for tournaments.
-They probably build talent from their kids programs and attract talent from other schools with a superior competition team, which leads to an even more superior competition team.
-They probably have a system for providing and accumulating sponsorships to help athletes pay for competitions and travel costs.
-They probably have means of marketing their athletes to help them gain exposure which leads to better sponsorship and seminar opportunities.
-I would guess that Jacare and Fabio Gurgel and perhaps others direct and manage all of these different elements into one organized system. Overseeing and directing the whole project.

What they probably do not do is leave anything to chance. I would guess that everything that team Alliance does, from teaching to training (non athletes and athletes alike) is well planned and systematically approached. 

Their primary focus, just like Lloyd's team these days is to produce belt winners at all levels.. especially the black belt.

They train accordingly, and have teams and training sessions dedicated to that goal, so it shows.

I wouldn't say they have some secret jiujitsu that nobody else knows.. those days are long gone.. Its all about proper training these days.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm a black belt, and I'm a hobbyist. I don't compete in anything. It took me 15 years. Guys who I trained with that competed in national level tournaments and even in Brazil took about 9 years to get black belt. I was also 30 when I started, they were teenagers. If we roll now as black belts, they win most of the time.

We have in house tournaments and my guys win a lot over their guys. My students win a lot in tournaments, at all belt levels (white,blue, and purple, don't have any brown belts under me yet). I have two amateur MMA fighters that are 6-1 with five submissions. I have plenty of stories of students who used BJJ to save their lives in real fights and LEO situations.

I will never be Rickson or Marcelo.

So am I legit? I think so, and if anyone doesn't think so, I don't care. I think a black belt should have dedication, knowledge, experience, be able to teach and demonstrate, and be able to perform to a certain level among their peers. My peers would be other black belts around 45 years of age, close to my size. Throw me in a group like that and I will do just fine. Throw me in the black belt adult division of the Mundials and I will probably be eliminated the first two minutes.

Black belts should also be a good representative of their instructor, team, or organization.

It seems some people have an unreasonable expectation of what a black belt is or should be. While performance is important, it should never be the only criteria. I personally know some Pan Am champs who can't teach, their students suck, and their lives are train wrecks. But they can tap me out nine out of ten times.

I know one day when I promote a black belt, they will represent me. They will be judged on more criteria than just being a bad ass on the mat.





your post tells me you have never trained in Brazil.

did you notice they have had jiu-jitsu in their country for decades and yet somehow they managed to continue keep the art strong?

you have a very provincial view of bjj. in the bigger picture, the brazilians don't care about the whole belt issue, you show up, you train. they accept that not every one is a competitor and expect that older or casual black belts aren't going to be the mythological mat-sharks.

just because you think that the burden is too great for these black belts, doesn't mean it is true.

i am one of those casual black belts. i have a life outside the mat, i have a career, a family and strong desire not to get injured by some wanna-be mat monster blue belt.

when you get to black belt and have a few years behind you, you realize the truth...

this is your journey and no one else's.

spend a few decades doing this and you will realize mat-sharks come and mat-sharks go, only a few make it to black belt and they have the attributes that is the hallmark of true greatness: tenancy and intestinal fortitude.

in someways, they have greater inner strength because they know they aren't the next rickson or fabio gurgel but show up anyway because they don't quit.

so, concern yourself not with the black belt's burden, we are handling it just fine after all it is a journey not a destination...



What surprised them was the difference in attitude from North Americans when it came to BJJ.
No one was 'focused' on belts and the perceived mythological skills of the black belt. He saw black belts get steamrolled by purple belts, and even saw black belts get submitted by very strong and competitive blue belts.
There werea lot of older black belts who had never competed, and would show up up after work to train, and then go home to their families. They would never beat any of the 'serious' trained guys there, at purple and above, but were seen as training partners, and sources of information.

There was also a DEFINITVE informal distinction between competitors and recreational practitioners. No one ever confused the two, and no one even blinked when a competitive purple would catch a recreational brown or black belt in a move. Another difference was that  there was lots of smiling during training he observed to, and chatter.
