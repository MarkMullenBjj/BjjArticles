GBC Training Notes


June 2011
- open guard passing principle
	no one is equal on their guard on both sides - and they will play their strong side. To pass, trun them onto their opposite hip to disarm the guard
	if the opponent has 1 sleeve controled, you don't want your hand/ arm free. anchor it with a grip on their belt. gi to defend possible triangles
	for the open guard, the opponent has a radius of effectivenss for their legs, the reach of their leverage. To pass, back away from their leverage and skirt around the periphery of their leg reach
	use a cross step to create a more favorable angle to push the opponents defending knees aside when passing. that large step across and pivot pushing in with a different angle
	
	
June 
The advanced way to get a paper cutter choke
	- the setup to get the under the shoulder grip comes form side control. the opponent has a defensive grip with prayer hands. you release your head control and move to north-south on opposite side to get your grip
	- the entry is from the same side - sneaking 4 fingers grip in. A looser grip results in allowing you to put your elbow down (blocking his head) as opposed to a trachea choke
	- if opponent is trying to defend by going to north-south, your choking arm can cross face

June
The corkscrew prevention of the stacking guard pass. I have always ended in a stalemate position - with finally the opponent reversing the direction of the pass to go around the opposite direction
JR suggested to grab the knee non the same side as the original stacking pass. When the opponent tries to reverse direction, i can stay squared and follow him.
** principle "when your opponent is going in a direction and you wish to follow, make a hook on a trailig limb to follow" "follow his trail - go in same direction as him, but a little faster"
*** follow up on how to advance position from the stalemate - solution: replace the guard with your knee across his belt first


June 29 - 1 stripe on brown belt
Situp guard sweep. opponent is standing and you execute a kouichigari from seated guard
	- put your head on inside, outside arm to secure the leg, hand posting behind you to move your hips
	- the movement is like a safety standup to base - the mechanism for the take down is pulling the opponents legs out and behind you
	- variation 2 - the head goes on the outside and the mechanism for the sweep is almost a knee bar - driving the opponent straight backwards
	- variation 3 - pass the opponents sleeve and hand on floor goes to opponents collar
	
JR's situp hand in collar guard
	- instead of cross grip on collar for choke, same side grip. There is no choke, but the hand may be used to create distance and also for a pull for sweep
	- leg position same as my situp/ hand in collar guard
	- floor basing hand will control the sleeve of sameside opponents hand - for scissors or stretch-side base sweep
	- opponent has 1 knee down and 1 knee up in combat base. JR sweeps 3 straight opponents by stretching them out on sleeve side, foot on knee that is down.
	- if opponent tries to pass to opposite side, your hand controlling his sleeve thrusts his arm across and you are set to take back
	
Double instep position to counter opponenets torreana guard pass
	- I have been catching the opponent's trailing leg when he tries to suddenly pass and i find myself with doubkle instep hooks on 1 side yet with my hips turned away
	- take a whizzer (tip: control closer to his wrist than elbow to prevent his posting and thwarting the sweep)
	- use the inside hook to hook sweep (almost a sumi-gaeshi) to your rear
	- your outside hook (the original hook that caught him) is posting and driving
	
	
July - Judo with Laurie Wiltshire
	- basic kumi-kata - usde your 2 hands to control the opponent's power hand when grip fighting
	- cross sleeve grip comes from this grip fighting. Laurie uses a hand on back of shoulder instead of belt grab. the reason being that the weight on back of opponent keeps his head/ posture down. 2nd: circle to opponents front to keep off balance as you are still in danger of your opponent's trhow if you go to back (like Oleg)
	- ken-ken uchimata from this position. it is a side throw using your hip bump to knock opponent over - even if he has planted his hand on the mat
	
	- osotogari against a defensive opponent. Step across opponent to negate stiff arm - to 45 degrees out
	- your heel goes on the back of his knee and you plant / corkscrew your leg down to the mat to break uke's ability to stand on that leg. the breakfall is hard!
	
	
JR's back clinic - August 17
	- handfighting for RNC. from seatbelt your underhook side will control sameside wrist, then you use a cross grab to dominate the 8unbderhook side wrist
	~ your goal is to cross grip both wrists - roll opponent to his stomach and choke from the back of the head - opponent will have his head turned one way
	- RNC pressure is to arch back - create the banana body
	- escape the rear mount - always go weak side - use your top side hook to kick out his bottom hook - both of your hands go pull down on his back of head,m circle out to north-south
	- when having escaped from rear mount - you are in 50-50 position. Both players try to cross grab the opponents bottom sleeve to prevent them from taking top. "Remove his post / if you use a leg hook, you are settling for bottom" - JR
	- arm drag from guard - jump over with pass to sidecontrol
	
Sept 28 - the Dope Mount
	- multiple entries:
	~ from half butterfly - you weave your hand underneath and grasp gi-tail; use to weave legs and dominate his knees together; get underhook and important to control opponents sleeve
	~ from reverse kesagatame  - when opponent tries to turn into you - hook his leg as you would when oging for conventional mount; look for dope knee position while turning almost to kesgatame orientation
	~ hop to Dope mount when opponent dies both hands in belt/ decline bench proess mount escape
	~ hope to Dope mount when opponent hook sweeps you
	
Oct 5 	- the sitting guard / one of the best JR classes ever
	- GREAT! basic movement from seated guard - opponent circling and steps to side. You push with same side arm (as opposed to cross arm for short armdrag), sideways hip scoop
	normally I had been doing an ankle pick when the opponent circles in that direction
	- whizzer defense to opponent trying underhook pass - hip scoot to side. This is very similar to the first fundamental movement
	- switch from kimura- hip buck sweep position. Important to apply downwards pressure with back of your shoulder onto the back of his shoulder, sideways hip scoot - like arm drag hip movement
	- jeff james straight arm-wrist/sleeve control - straight arm -your hand buried close to your hip. scoot hips away then square up
	- to pass that straight arm, continue and circle around to head
	
Oct 19  - the open guard 
	- * refinement to the straight arm-wrist/sleeve control - wait until the opponent releases his grip on your knees to make the hip switch easier - as opposed to having to break the grip with only your hip switch
	- keep the arm buried/braced in your hip
	- this works best when opponent has turned your hips away with torreana pass
	- Sweep principles: 	when sweeping, do not position your starting point where you need to move the opponent completely across your body. Scoot the hips and create the favorable angle
				always look to undermine the opponents base - especially deep half - scoot and get under the other side of the opponents centre line
				when you have an underhook from 1/2 or open guard, try to shuck opponent forward/ put his head on the mat to create the room to scoot to back
				to drag opponent down from a 1/2 turtle - if you can't get the opposite lapel, use your hand cupping inside of his thigh to pull him over while bracing his near side elbow with your free hand
				always look for the opponents centre line - especially in passing the guard,. anytime you can get off centre and stop opponent from squaring up it is your advantage
				do not get stuck on going only in a straightforward direction; any stalled, failed technique - try to go the opposite direction to take advanatge of the opponent's shifteed base
	- from Zguard, use your shield knee as a spider hook with your hand cupping back of opp's arm. When you kick your leg straight and swim your hand to underhook you will have thrown opponent's balance forward onto his hands and opening your path to his back
	
Oct 16 	- Friday night open mat
	- use sasaetrurikomiashi when opponent is going backwards - this is similar to the Delcides 3 steps pushing opponent backwards and then turning and hitting the sasae
	- Garrett's Royler armbar - some tips:
			- turn opponent onto his side, your grip very deep
			- move to north south position
			- get your knee high and deep in his armpit - if you lean back alomost torquing the opponent's arm he will lose his strength in that arm
			- make the switch from your knee outside to inside, really trapping his arm. this doesn't feel very tight and the opp's arm may still be bent. the switch is the tricky part
			- post your hand on the mat to step over
			- sit back for lock

Oct 31	- closed guard fundamentals
	- use the Braulio Estima posture break on his bracing arm. Cross lapel grab on his posting arm. Lever/ crow bar down to break his brace and goose him forward with your leg to break posture - this worked great against strong posture!
	- ask about Josh's variation of the air guitar escape - he rolls opponent onto 1 side to make room and then hitch-hikes hand inside - not as vulnerable as limp arm escape. 
	- + control his free arm so as to block the other offense he can try when you are limp arming
	

Nov 16 	- scissors guard semi-private with JR * many videos!
	- JR recommended that I concentrate on scissors guard - and go for triangles, but not with the end result being a triangle - but an armbar
	- tips on the armbar:
	~ break his posture by pulling in with the hamstrings/ back on knees
	~ cross his arm over to center
	~ cinch your thigh grip further down on the triceps/ back of his ram to block his shoulder (climbing guard armbar) stright on orientation of the armbar
	~ seize the timing when 
	~ var#2 - if you want to turn and create the angle - instead of spinning yourself underneath / use your top leg to push him away & cross ankles

Nov 17 	- doing reps (Jay Van) with this triangle setup to armbar discovered a couple of things: using the grab the ankle to create pressure on back of neck/ HARD bite down is the key to breaking the posture
	- Bray's foot in the hip helps stop opponent from stacking you and helps straighten opp's arm out
	- switching your ankles (which one is on top) makes a 20% difference in how tight your leg covering shoulder is
	*** little bumps of JR - ask more ***
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nov 22 - training notes
	- JR showed a variation of hook sweep from sitting guard with sleeve collar grip - but collar grip was not on choking side - on safe side. bury the opponet's hand in his waist to do the sweep
	~ seems the best timing is for when the opponent is trying to pass and coming forward - as opposed t0o sitting back
	- during the roll with JR - a technique that worked for me was when JR was attempting to roll me over (clock choke counter style) due to my lapel grip over his back.
	~ I saw this on Marcelo Garcia - you must beat his roll but jumping your rear mount to the opposite side and get a rear mount control. Wokred nicely!
	

Nov 25 - Romulo Barral Seminar
	- spider guard fundamentals: use your staggered legs with straight leg on the opposite side of the direction that he is wanting to pass
	- when opponent is trying to pass to one side and begin to lay your legs flat, make a small hip escape the square back up to opponent
	- opponent is attempting double underhook guard pass - 3 phases of escape
	1) early - control both sleeves and make your legs heavy and knees splayed wide
	2) mid - opponent has clasped his hands - jiggy your legs to break his grip and shoulder walk backwards
	3) late - opponent has elevated your hips and made gable grip - straighten your legs stiff as  board and then push UP on his elbows to allow your legs to slide down and out
	
	~ for the 'Lasso" hook, anchor your forearm behind your knee to create a brace 
	~ "keep the tension" 100 times in the seminar
	~ opponent is standing and steps back to disengage and go to torreana pass. Immediately straighten your legs and go to feet on hips/ balloon sweep. Very effective
	~ "use your defensive guard to frustrate your opponent and wait his mistake"
	
	- the Kayron hand in collar guard with spider biceps control. The push with foot and pull with collar hand rotates the opp's upper body and breaks the posture. "KEEP THE TENSION!!!"
	~ you can sweep to either side.
	~ ** the most important thing I got from the seminar was to break the balance of the opponent before transitioning to a new grip **
	~ Barral used the spider hook to bump the opponent forward allowing you to lose the lasso control and move to collar control
	~ if the opponent is backing out and trying to disengage, use your free foot to post on mat and scoot forwards and underneath the opponent
	
	- go to De La Riva guard if opponent angles to pass - control both sleeves. there is a strong sweep to the rear corner
	~ if opponent leans awy from the sweep, you can look for omoplata
	
	- opponent has 1 knee down
	~ sweep to collar hand side with flower sweep/pendulum leg motion. 
	~ opponent will be forced to put his hand down to post and avoid the sweep - this is your opening for the triangle
	~ you will be on your wrong hip/ angle immediately after the sweep - so your pendulum leg must post on floor and scoot your hips to oppsoite angle for triangle
	~ omo plata or triangle here
	
	** private advice. I asked Romulo about taking the armbar from the triangle
	~ the traditional armbar setup is "just something in the books" - not how you really get the armbar
	~ you must break his posture - hand on back of head and go to full closed triangle - your hand controlling shin
	~ he used the Kahn/shoulder jump armbar hand technique - which was to sideways stuff the opponents elbow inside and simulatneously shoulder jump to block the opponent's shoulder - while breaking posture with hands on the back of the head
	~ he did both straight armlock with shoulder pinch and leg over the face
	
	- knee cut pass
	~ to clear the scissors knee he used his hand to pop the knee out of the way / while controlling opponent's collar with free hand (the opposite of the usual choking hand)
	~ he stressed to not be in a hurry for the pass - to sit back on the opponent's knee/leg to pause before going forward
	~ next move is to secure DEEP collar grip and control the sleeve (as in knee on belly)
	~ he alternated a through-the-middle painful knee ride with switching the knee out to pass 
	~ Barral stressed that the proper direction to cut the knee was NOT paralell to the opponent but out to the side and sit on the mat
	~ to get the hand in collar deep, he even used the free hand to pull the back of opponent's head forward, almost like when you are trying to tighten the Darce choke 
	~ Barral said that when you relase the opponent's arm on mat, that he will naturally look to come up and take your back with underhook - THIS was the correct timing to do the choke
	~ DEEP choking hand
	
	
	Q& A
	- spend A LOT of time in the positions that you want to excell at. Drilling and positional sparring are key
	- best posture to defend the spider guard is to break the collar grip
	- grip strength comes form training the spiderguard - no one can use their maximum grip for 10 minutes - "your forearms will fill like Popeye"
	- you must learn when to grip hard and when to relax your grip when it is not needed
	- he acknowledged that there is zero spider guard with no-gi. if one of the best practitioners in the world says he couldnt make it work,...forget it
	
	
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	
Nov 28	- JR got me in an omoplata and it was the first time I was caught in one in several years
	~ he used the leg press leg to push me forward and break my balance to the front; depriving me of my kneeling base
	~ controlling my pants at the knee - he PUSHED me away (negating my roll/ step over counters) and shrimped away hard to flatten me out. The push on the knee was the big difference in stretching me out and removing my base
	
Jan 4	- JR - knee on belly / peanut butter and jam - the strategy is to get your position and then wait to see how opponent will move as opposed to forcing a specific move
	- Victory lapel wrap to back take + armlock
	- get a deep wrap on the victory style; turn opponent onto side facing away from you and do chair sit
	- when you pull the opponent over - triangle his shoulder (trapped arm) and go to armlock
	- Slim's guillotine from front headlock tip - go for the Bakersfield from front head and arm - opponent will seek to open his arm to create space for his nec. This will create the opportunity and opening for you to get both hands inside for guillotine. Go to half legs position - on your side; put his head in the hole
	
Jan 12	- JR - knee slice armbar from knee on belly - use the slice on both sides armbar
	- when going for 180 armbar, don't step flat footed - stay on ball of feet so you can get a pivot and then in a 2nd movement, get the knee slice. Fallas close to his legs as possible to achieve the optimal angle to prevent his hitchhiker escape
	- ** armbar tip - PULL the arm. this wekanes the stability of the joint and makes the lock more painful **
	- I articulated the JR - submission philiosophy: take a mount; watch for the opp's best escape attempt; counter; he will go to his 2nd; counter without trying for a submission prematurely; when opponent loses his will and settles down, attack immediately
	- use a 'scream to knee on belly, from opponent trying to stuff your knee escape from knee on belly; opp ends up facing away from you and your position gets better
	- * when rolling with JR - when trying to pass the guard and he was dominating a sleeve grip - I grabbed his belt as a counter to being armlocked or triangled on that dominated arm
	
Feb 1	- JR shows multiple ways to get dope mount ~ 2 entries from rear scarf hold / ushiro kesgatame
	- 1) opponent has legs crossed to prevent your standard mount. Reach up and hook between his ankle & knee to pull your body up and over. 1/2 way over, switch to dope mount (facing almost kesgatame away from opponent & crossiing over to other side) 
	- 2) opponent is trying to reach your legs by facing into you and hooking your free leg. Grasp far leg pants and turn his hips towatrds you and pin his knee on the floor. Use your foot as though you were doing Roger Gracie mount yet don't carry over to mount yet
	~ instead, turn your hips back to the same side that you were into a kesagatame- type of position and Dope mount entry
	** tips for effective Dope mount: spiral or twister his body to make him as uncomfortable as possible. Your knee up high / under his hamstring to squish him
	** don't put your bodyweight on your knee - rather, place your weight on his hips
	** your upper BW should be on his fat shoulder to flatten him out and maximize the body torque
	** pull his sleeve UP to help flatten him out
	
Feb 14	- when you have come to your knees / turtle bottom - to sit back to guard, grasp opponent's knees on outide and place butterfly hook; opo your head out on opposite side to sit back. You are ready to hit butterfly sweep as soon as you load opponent
	- to take single leg from side control escape - instead of taking his ankle from inside (leaves you vulnerable to get crucifixed) take outside single
	** you can grasp the ankle from outside and windshield wiper his legs to toutside and creating pressure on his hip
	
Feb 15	- mounted gift wrap - go to sleeve choke
	- take kimura grip from gift wrap - instead of controlling opponent's wrist with the crook of your elbow, use your opposite side hand to control opp's wrist to prevent hitch-hiker escape
	- if opponent has S-mounted you, both hands inside escape - but don't throw his legs away and create a scramble that you lose. Keep the pants cuff, other hand under his butt/belt; hip out and dump him backwards onto his back
	** tip for the blackbelt armbar ~ use your free arm to adjust his far arm to make your s-mount leg tighter
	
March 28	- passing the open guard. I have been using more of a principle based approach as opposed to set techniques (although my early attempts at leg drag have been very successful!)
		- try to stay outside of the opponent's open guard range, eliminate hooks patiently before passing
		- majority of guys will show their strong side - try to use footwork to move him from side to side/ hip to hip until you get ahead and or feel his discomfort
		- go to leg drag, cross step (from 1 foot forward standing guard stance) - you can control either knee to prevent him turtling away from you
		- * principle "most people get stuck on wanting to go immediately to side control" - instead, continue your circle around to north south after torreana (tandoori) guard pass
		- "80% of your passes should be pressure passes" "fast passes should be used mostly in transition"
		- counter to situp guard when opponent wants to stand up to base. I usually control his bottom ankle. JR says to "make the top leg the bottom ankle" by turning him on his hip to the other side. This also negates the grip in your collar
		- ** see previous principle
		
May 2	- mounted armlock - continue to belly down armlock when opponent tries hitchhiker escape
	- ** tip on stopping hitchhiker escape -your foot cloest to his head "jams down hard on his shoulder" to prevent his movement
	- 2 escapes from mounted stalled armlock 1) stuff his leg into half guard; now have room to get your elbow on the mat
						2) grab your own collar; lion kill grip to push opponents leg off of your face; bridge backwards and then turn into opponent	
		
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aug 5 	- Zguard/ 1/2 guard position & options
	** tip - use your shielding knee higher to prevent it from being squashed with weaving pass
	- options: reguard to full guard, use whizzer to get up and go to front headlock
	- take the back - use hand in collar/ scissor sweep to get opponent to put his hand on the mat (similar to the Bruno Fernandez choke mechanism)
	~ then use the space/ opponent's off balancing to snatch the underhook and take the back
	- triangle - using whizzer, go to step over to mount. when opp squares up to you, use your top leg as a pivot point to spin back undwer and catch the triangle/ 1arm and his head
	
Aug 10 	- hand in belt knot guard pass * worked on JR
	~ this grip negates the threat of being submitted by triangle and allows you to control opp's hips
	~ JR said to use your free hand to perform a leg drag. experiment with different low pants grips
	~ Clifton said to pull belt, force opponent to situp in his guard > this will momentarily make him lose the tension between his legs and your hips, pass in this moment
	
Aug 28	- turtle rollover - 1) control far pants leg to prevent opponent from walking around to all fours 2) bridge back to keep opp flat
	- back escape - weak side
	~ control opp's elbow to prevent opp from getting elbow on mat and coming to top
	~ get your head higher than opp's
	~ use top hand to remove opp's top hook (by the heel of his foot); close the space so her can not replace
	~ use your instep of freed top foot to kick off opp's bottom hook and free your bottom leg
	~ secure same kesgatame variation as you use to control in turtle rollover escape
	
	- paper cutter choke counter
	~ you can try to choke opponent right back to hinder his ability to apply full weight
	~ same arm as his controlling grip, reach up and have 4 fingers in collar - pull down and will prevent opp from applying full weight to the choke
	~ fake a bridge/hitchhiker escape motion and then rolloy polly legs in opposite dirfection - use free hand to grasp opp's belt and pull yourself to top position
	
Sept	- omoplata tips
	~ pull opp's sleeve at the elbow to keep arm in tight
	~ do not worry about triangling legs so early, straight your legs to put his shoulder on mat (esp the inside leg to be heavy)
	~ scoot away to flatten opponent's base
	
	- choke from guard
	~ create angle with foot on hip and armlock motion - strong push on the biting leg to break the opp's balance
	~ over hand 2nd hand grip is better for most angles
	~ ** look for armlock combination
	~ if opp creates good posture, sit up (his face in your chest) kick his knees out and flatten him completely out
	
	- Whizzer choke - head to head turtle - whizzer deep collar grip (not too deep for choke)
	~ 2nd hand - 4 fingers in top of collar
	~ sit to 1/2 guard and bring 2nd hand around to choke
	~ * to advance the position, you may use your 2nd hand to pry opp's jaw and roll him over to the other side and get on top
	
	
Oct 5
	- Reverse DLR hook choke
	~ I get into this position when i go to scissors sweep and opp posts a leg > go to Reverse DLR hook > go to sweep > opp posts hand you get 2nd hand in collar
	~ what to do with legs? get butterfly guard, extend opp backwards, situp, scoot back and go to Carlson feet on hips
	
	- Turtle rollover - how to advance the position?
	~ turn towards opp legs to go to mount > KEEP the arm! > roll opps knees towards you and step over, triangle opps legs before you release control of the sleeve
	
	- clock choke - can't break opps wrist down and get his head on the mat
	~ go to "yoke choke" - your arm over his other side of his head (weight on back of opps neck so he can't raise up) > use free hand to overhook your leg like makura kesa-gatame
	> keep collar grip and jump around to opposite of body > free hand grasp opp's far sleeve / pants knee > tuck your head and roll under the opp > finish on top
	
	- advancing from omoplata - opps posture has been broken flat
	~ keep the elbow/sleeve grip!
	~ release pants grip and palm up grip on belt > sitp and windshirld wiper legs to finish - not necessary to triangle legs unless no-gi
	
	Choke from guard
	- lots of time spent on choking from guard
	~ posture breaks
	~ getting 2nd hand in deep; feet in hips; baloon sweep
	~ counters > pressure forward and pinch elbows, knee cut to armbar from side control
	~ ring chinups with cross kimono grip - improved my grip!
