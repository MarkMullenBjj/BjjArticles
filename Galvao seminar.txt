- reguarding
	~ motorcycle grip, thumbless on biceps - if you try to control wrist, opp can use knee to pin your arm and secure your head
	~ keep your bottom elbow on floor and ** push his elbow into his own body
	~ * if opp tries to circvle arm up and out - go to Heisman side control escape * tip- going up on your elbow is better than fully up on extended arm
	~ torreana pass: stuff his arm at triceps so he can not use to release grip and control your head; gather his face and push across your body and hip away; block opp from jumping over to opposite side of your body to your back by using your leg

- spider guard
	~ you must prevent opponent from stripping your collar grip as priority; your sleeve grip pull opponents arm HIGH
	~ to prepare opp for any guard attack, you must use collar grip & foot on biceps to rotate opponents upper body (shoulders in straight vertical line)
	~ omoplata - pinch BOTH of your knees together on opp's arm. the inside knee is used to prevent opp from defending omoplata and coming back inside your guard squared up
	~ straight both legs and pitch opp forward; keep collar grip so if opp stands to defend, he must carry all of your weight on his head
	~ unwrap opponents far lapel and wrap (similar to brabo wrap); use other hand to grip opp's ankle and hip away putting him down on his face
	
- mono plata from 1/2 mount > underhook backstep entry
	~ backstep > control opp's upperr leg/ knee to prevent him from coming to top
	~ cross face not needed, just place your hands on mat for balance to backstep
	~ after backstep, opp will seek underhook; shrimp backwards to pull your knee free of half guard control (opp keeps ankle)
	~ once opponent has secured underhook, jump back over into 3/4 mount and attack monoplata on opposite side
	~ shift your weight onto a hand to create space to bring your foot in front of opp's face
	~ shift weight on hand again and fall back to mono > up on your elbow (closest to head) and other hand cross grip opp's elbow > roll your hips over to effect the shoulder torque
	
side control > spin to back control transition
	~ your hand on opp's hip tpo prevent him from turning into you so easily > same time your leg near head straightens (make straight line with his body)
	~ 2 actions at same time: 1) drop your elbow across opp's body (not super heavy) and 2) pivot on straight leg to make backstep to temp kesgatame like position
	~ * temp kesgatame like position only meant to be held for a moment - you are out of balance
	~ if opp tries to put back on mat - use your chest to prevent him from turning back down/ if opp tries to turn to turtle, you have high lapel grip and ** use your elbow to block opp's hip
	~ your leg position in this fetus position: knee up high to hids head and other knee almost knee on belly type of pressure on opp's hip
	~ * this will allow you to follow opps body and MAKE THE CONNECTION as he moves
	~ bottom hook comes in first
